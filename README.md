## Synopsis

Web-based cheatsheet for several popular icon fonts. 


## Fonts Included
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* [Entypo](http://www.entypo.com/)
* [Typicons](http://typicons.com/)
* [Foundation Icon Font](http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3)
* [States](http://propublica.github.io/stateface/)
* [Countries](http://www.dafont.com/geobats.font)


## Motivation

1. I see my peers wireframing in [Axure](http://www.axure.com/) and using symbol fonts on a daily basis.
2. I noticed that the Cheat Sheet is promoted in the search results for [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), so I assume it is one of the most frequented pages on the site.
